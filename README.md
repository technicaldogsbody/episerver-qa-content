# episerver-qa-content
A simple episerver project with a couple of basic page types to show how an Initializable Module can be used to generate pages that QA and UAT teams can use during their testing/sign off process. 

I have used Bogus and Waffle to generate realistic content, the Faker classes can be found in the business module along with the module.
